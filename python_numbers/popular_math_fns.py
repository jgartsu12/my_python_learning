# automate processes talked aabout and call them on numbes via math fns

print(math.floor(product_cost)) 
# could have just called int() --> may not do cuz floor clearly shows ur intention --> explicit intentions w/ floor
        # math floor --> wanted rounded down lower value of product_cost ... int() --> intention to convert to an integer
