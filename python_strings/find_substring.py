sentence = 'The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.'
# find method
query = sentence.find('qui')
print(query) # prints 4 cuz qui is in quick which is in the fourth index in the str in sentence variable ... matches letters in the string in query called a substring
# index
# in method
# why use one method over the other
