# Using Python's replace Function to Find and Replace String Values
sentence = 'The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog'

sentence = 'New Value'

print(sentence)
# prints New Value since not touching str but replacing what is stored in sentence variable --> IT DID NOT CHANGE STR sinces strs are immutable
